Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighbourhoods (Week 2)
Submit by June 30, 11:59 PM PDT
Important Information
It is especially important to submit this assignment before the deadline, June
30, 11:59 PM PDT, because it must be graded by others. If you submit late, there
 may not be enough classmates around to review your work. This makes it difficult
  - and in some cases, impossible - to produce a grade. Submit on time to avoid
  these risks.

Instructions:
In this week, you will continue working on your capstone project. Please remember
 by the end of this week, you will need to submit the following:

A full report consisting of all of the following components (15 marks):

Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested
in this project.
Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the
source of the data.
Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you
discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential
statistical testing that you performed, and what machine learnings were used and
why.
Results section where you discuss the results.
Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any
recommendations you can make based on the results.
Conclusion section where you conclude the report.

2. A link to your Notebook on your Github repository pushed showing your code.
(15 marks)

3. Your choice of a presentation or blogpost. (10 marks)

Here are examples of previous outstanding submissions that should give you an
idea of what your report would look like, what your notebook would look like in
terms of clean, clear, and well-commented code, and what your presentation would
look like or your blogpost would look like:

Report: https://cocl.us/coursera_capstone_report
Notebook: https://cocl.us/coursera_capstone_notebook
Presentation: https://cocl.us/coursera_capstone_presentation
Blogpost: https://cocl.us/coursera_capstone_blogpost

Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Project - The Battle of neighbourhoods (Week 1)

You passed!

Congratulations. You earned 30 / 30 points. Review the feedback below and continue
the course when you are ready. You can also help more classmates by reviewing their
 submissions.

Instructions:
Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data
to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have
the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage
the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighbourhoods or cities of your
choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data
to solve. If you cannot think of an idea or a problem, here are some ideas to get
you started:

In Module 3, we explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and
clustered their neighbourhoods. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial
capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare
the neighbourhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they
are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city?
I will leave it to you to refine this idea.
In a city of your choice, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would
you recommend that they open it? Similarly, if a contractor is trying to start their
own business, where would you recommend that they setup their office?
These are just a couple of many ideas and problems that can be solved using location
data in addition to other datasets. No matter what you decide to do, make sure to
provide sufficient justification of why you think what you want to do or solve is
important and why would a client or a group of people be interested in your project.

Review criteria:
This capstone project will be graded by your peers. This capstone project is worth

70% of your total grade. The project will be completed over the course of 2 weeks.
Week 1 submissions will be worth 30% whereas week 2 submissions will be worth 40%
of your total grade.

For this week, you will required to submit the following:

A description of the problem and a discussion of the background. (15 marks)
A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem. (15 marks)
For the second week, the final deliverables of the project will be:

A link to your Notebook on your Github repository, showing your code. (15 marks)
A full report consisting of all of the following components (15 marks):
Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested
in this project.
Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the
source of the data.
Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you
discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential
statistical testing that you performed, and what machine learnings were used and why.
Results section where you discuss the results.
Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any
recommendations you can make based on the results.
Conclusion section where you conclude the report.
3. Your choice of a presentation or blogpost. (10 marks)
